📱 Smart Yoga Mat – Flutter App
The Smart Yoga Mat app is a mobile application prototype built using Flutter to simulate the functionality of an IoT-powered yoga mat. It helps users engage in yoga sessions with visual feedback, simulated pressure detection, OTA update features, and more — even without connecting to real hardware.

Key Features:

🎮 Mat Control Panel: Choose between modes like Start Warm-Up or Begin Relaxation with real-time feedback.

🧘 Stick Figure Visualization: A live animated stick figure shows user posture based on pressure data.

🛠 Simulated Pressure Zones: Different mat zones react to mock pressure values to reflect movement.

🚀 OTA Updates: Users can check for firmware updates, see version info, and simulate update installation.

🛍 Product Showcase: A scrollable section to highlight new yoga mat products and features with links.

📡 Simulated Connectivity: Mimics Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connection status for testing user experience flow.

This app creatively brings a smart yoga mat experience to life using custom visual components and simulated data, laying the groundwork for real device integration in the future.
